/**
 * Centralised React Query key factories.
 *
 * Having every contract query derive its key from one place keeps cache
 * invalidation consistent and avoids the typo-prone scattering of inline
 * `["invoices"]` arrays across the codebase.
 *
 * NOTE: the values returned here intentionally match the literal keys that
 * already existed in the app (e.g. `["invoices"]`, `["invoice", id]`,
 * `["contract-stats"]`) so existing consumers — such as the contract event
 * sync that invalidates `["invoice", id]` — keep matching the same cache
 * entries.
